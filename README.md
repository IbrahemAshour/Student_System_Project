A student management system is a software application that helps educational institutions manage student data and handle various student-related tasks. In this project, we'll create a simple student management system using C.

## Features

1. **Student Registration**:
   - Students can register for courses and enter their personal and contact information.
2. **Course Management**:
   - Manage courses, class schedules, and teacher assignments.
3. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Track student attendance and generate attendance reports.
4. **Grades and Transcripts**:
   - Track student grades and generate transcripts.

## How to Create the System

### 1. Plan and Design

Before coding, plan and design your student management system. Determine the features you want to include.

### 2. Data Structures

We'll use a `struct` array to store student information. Here's a basic example:

```c
struct Student {
	char*name;
	char*password;
	char age;
	char*gender;
	int total_grade;
	int id;
	struct student *next;
		 
};
```

### 3. Functions

Create functions for student registration, course management, attendance tracking, and grade management.

### 4. File Handling

Use files to store student records. Implement functions to add, search, modify, and delete records.

### 5. Compile and Run

Compile your code and run the program. Test each feature to ensure it works correctly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the executable.
